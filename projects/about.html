    	<h2>The Music</h2>
    	<p>Our vast library of over 70,000 songs, can assure you that music in every genre will be covered with crisp, clear sound. From digitally remastered oldies, to today's top hits, we have them all. Using only music purchased through reputable sites like iTunes and Rhapsody, we are able to have this library with every song on the Billboard top 100 from 1958 to today. If by chance there is a track we do not have in our library, on the spot download capabilities takes care of that (as long as the venue has wi-fi, and the song is available through iTunes, or Rhapsody). Having this ability takes our shows to an all new level, being able to play for even the most diverse crowds. Keeping these tracks on multiple computers, external drives, and cd backups, makes our systems the most reliable in the industry. </p>
