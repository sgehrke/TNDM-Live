    	<p>Choosing our Platinum wedding package with our all-new Up-lighting will put that elegant touch on your wedding you have been searching for. Along with up-lighting this package includes an entire day of service. We will be there hours before your guests arrive, setting up and making sure everything is perfect for your day. As your guest arrive, cocktail music, in the style of your choice will be played, and announcements made so your guests are directed where they need to be. Going into dinner we will transition the music to a more romantic level while you prepare for your Grand entrance. During dinner, a PA system with multiple wireless microphones will be supplied for your speeches and toasts. After dinner, all of your special dances and grand march can be tailored to your needs, creating a unique reception every time.
